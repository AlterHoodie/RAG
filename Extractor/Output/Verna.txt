fuel requirements gasoline engine unleaded y our new vehicle is designed to perform optimally using unleaded fuel having an  octane rating of ron (research octane number) 91/aki (anti-knock index) 87 or  higher. (do not use methanol blended fuels) y our new vehicle is designed to obtain maximum performance with unleaded fuel,  as well as minimize exhaust emissions and spark plug fouling. notice never use leaded fuel. the use of leaded fuel is detrimental to the catalytic  converter and will damage the engine control system’s oxygen sensor and affect  emission control. also, severe wear and crack of piston ring, valve, etc. may occur and knocking noise  may be heard from your engine. never add any fuel system cleaning agents to the fuel tank other than what has been  specified (we recommend that you consult an authorized hyundai dealer for details.)  warning • do not “top off” after the nozzle automatically shuts off when refueling. • always check that the fuel cap is installed securely to prevent fuel spillage in the  event of an accident.

gasoline containing alcohol and methanol gasohol, a mixture of gasoline and ethanol (also known as grain alcohol), and gasoline  or gasohol containing methanol (also known as wood alcohol) are being marketed  along with or instead of leaded or unleaded gasoline. do not use gasohol containing more than 20% ethanol, and do not use gasoline or  gasohol containing any methanol. either of these fuels may cause drivability problems  and damage to the fuel system, engine control system and emission control system. discontinue using gasohol of any kind if drivability problems occur. vehicle damage or driveability problems may not be covered by the manufacturer’s  warranty if they result from the use of: 1. gasohol containing more than 20% ethanol. 2. gasoline or gasohol containing methanol. 3. leaded fuel or leaded gasohol. notice never use gasohol which contains methanol. discontinue use of any gasohol product  which impairs drivability. using fuel additives using fuel additives such as: - silicone fuel additive - mmt (manganese, mn) fuel additive - ferrocene (iron-based) fuel additive - other metallic-based fuel additives may result in cylinder misfire, poor acceleration, engine stalling, engine plugging, heavy  knocking noise, damage to the catalyst, or abnormal corrosion, and may cause damage  to the engine resulting in a reduction in the overall life of the powertrain. the notice damage to the fuel system or performance problem caused by the use of these fuels  may not be covered by your new vehicle limited warranty.

use of mtbe hyundai recommends avoiding fuels containing mtbe (methyl t ertiary butyl ether)  over 15.0% vol. (oxygen content 2.7% weight) in your vehicle. fuel containing mtbe over 15.0% vol. (oxygen content 2.7% weight) may reduce  vehicle performance and produce vapor lock or hard starting. notice y our new vehicle limited warranty may not cover damage to the fuel system and any  performance problems that are caused by the use of fuels containing methanol or fuels  containing mtbe (methyl t ertiary butyl ether) over 15.0% vol. (oxygen content 2.7%  weight.) do not use methanol fuels containing methanol (wood alcohol) should not be used in your vehicle. this type  of fuel can reduce vehicle performance and damage components of the fuel system,  engine control system and emission control system. fuel additives hyundai recommends that you use unleaded gasoline which has an octane rating of  ron (research octane number) 95/aki (anti knock index) 91/aki (anti-knock index)  87 or higher. for customers who do not use good quality gasolines, and have problems starting  or the engine does not run smoothly, one bottle of additive added to the fuel tank  is recommended according to the maintenance schedule (refer to the “normal  maintenance schedule” section in chapter 9). additives are available from your authorized hyundai dealer along with information on  how to use them. do not mix other additives. operation in foreign countries if you are going to drive your vehicle in another country, be sure to: • observe all regulations regarding registration and insurance. • determine that acceptable fuel is available.

vehicle modifica tions • this vehicle should not be modified. modification of your vehicle could affect its  performance, safety or durability and may even violate governmental safety and  emissions regulations. in addition, damage or performance problems resulting from any modification may  not be covered under warranty. • if you use unauthorized electronic devices, it may cause the vehicle to operate  abnormally, wire damage, battery discharge and fire. for your safety, we recommend  that you do not use unauthorized electronic devices. notice some warning sounds (including welcome/good-bye sound, etc.) are generated from  the exterior amplifiers. if necessary, we recommend you to purchase hyundai parts to  replace an exterior amplifier. any unauthorized product may cause a malfunction of the  exterior amplifiers.

vehicle break-in process by following a few simple precautions for the first 1,000 km (600 mi.) you may add to  the performance, economy and life of your vehicle. • do not race the engine. • while driving, avoid sudden acceleration. • do not maintain a single speed for long periods of time, either fast or slow. varying  engine speed is needed to properly break-in the engine. • avoid hard stops, except in emergencies, to allow the brakes to seat properly. • do not tow a trailer during the first 2,000 km (1,200 mi.) of operation. • fuel economy and engine performance may vary depending on vehicle break-in  process and be stabilized after 6,000 km (4,000 mi.). new engines may consume  more oil during the vehicle break-in period.

recommended sae viscosity number notice • always be sure to clean the area around any filler plug, drain plug, or dipstick  before checking or draining any lubricant. this is especially important in dusty or  sandy areas and when the vehicle is used on unpaved roads. cleaning the plug  and dipstick areas will prevent dirt and grit from entering the engine and other  mechanisms that could be damaged. • never add any additives to the engine oil. engine oil additives can change the  properties of engine oil and may cause serious engine failure. engine oil viscosity (thickness) has an effect on fuel economy and cold weather  operating (engine start and engine oil flowability). lower viscosity engine oils can  provide better fuel economy and cold weather performance, however, higher viscosity  engine oils are required for satisfactory lubrication in hot weather. using oils of any  viscosity other than those recommended could result in engine damage. when choosing an oil, consider the range of temperature your vehicle will be operated  in before the next oil change. proceed to select the recommended oil viscosity from  the chart. temperature range for sae viscosity numberstemperature °c -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 (°f) -10 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 smartstream g1.5 *1 0w-20 0w-20 smartstream g1.5 t-gdi *2 0w-20 0w-20 *1 : requires <api sn plus (or above) full synthetic> grade engine oil. if a lower grade  engine oil (mineral oil including semi-synthetic) is used, then the engine oil and engine  oil filter must be replaced as indicated severe maintenance condition.  *2 : if a lower grade engine oil (mineral oil including semi-synthetic) is used, then the engine  oil and engine oil filter must be replaced as indicated severe maintenance condition. an engine oil displaying this api certification mark conforms to  the international lubricant specification advisory committee  (ilsac). it is recommended to only use engine oils that uphold  this api certification mark.

important safety precautionsyou will find many safety precautions  and recommendations throughout this  section, and throughout this manual.  the safety precautions in this section are  among the most important. always wear your seat belt a seat belt is your best protection in all  types of accidents. airbags are designed  to supplement seat belts, not replace  them. so even though your vehicle is  equipped with airbags, always make  sure you and your passengers wear your  seat belts, and wear them properly. restrain all children all children under age 13 should ride  in your vehicle properly restrained in a  rear seat, not the front seat. infants and  small children should be restrained in  an appropriate child restraint system.  larger children should use a booster  seat with the lap/shoulder belt until they  can use the seat belt properly without a  booster seat. airbag hazards while airbags can save lives, they can  also cause serious or fatal injuries to  occupants who sit too close to them, or  who are not properly restrained. infants,  young children, and short adults are at  the greatest risk of being injured by an  inflating airbag. follow all instructions  and warnings in this manual. driver distraction driver distraction presents a serious and  potentially deadly danger, especially for  inexperienced drivers. safety should be  the first concern when behind the wheel  and drivers need to be aware of the wide  array of potential distractions, such as  drowsiness, reaching for objects, eating,  personal grooming, other passengers,  and using mobile phones.drivers can become distracted when  they take their eyes and attention off  the road or their hands off the wheel to  focus on activities other than driving.  to reduce your risk of distraction and an  accident: • always set up your mobile devices  (for example, mp3 players, phones,  navigation units, etc.) when your  vehicle is parked or safely stopped. • only use your mobile device when  allowed by laws and conditions permit  safe use. never text or email while  driving. most countries have laws  prohibiting drivers from texting. some  countries and cities also prohibit  drivers from using handheld phones. • never let the use of a mobile device  distract you from driving. you have a  responsibility to your passengers and  others on the road to always drive  safely, with your hands on the wheel  as well as your eyes and attention on  the road. control your speed excessive speed is a major factor in crash  injuries and deaths. generally, the higher  the speed, the greater the risk, but  serious injuries can also occur at lower  speeds. never drive faster than is safe  for current conditions, regardless of the  maximum speed posted. keep your vehicle in safe  condition having a tire blowout or a mechanical  failure can be extremely hazardous. to  reduce the possibility of such problems,  check your tire pressures and condition  frequently, and perform all regularly  scheduled maintenance.

curtain airbags (if equipped)obn7i033041 obn7i033041 curtain airbags are located along both  sides of the roof rails above the front and  rear doors. they are designed to help protect the  heads of the front seat occupants and  the rear outboard seat occupants in  certain side impact collisions. the curtain airbags are designed to  deploy during certain side impact  collisions, depending on the crash  severity. the curtain airbags are not designed to  deploy in all side impact situations.warning to reduce the risk of serious injury or  death from an inflating curtain airbag,  take the following precautions: • all seat occupants must wear  seat belts at all times to help keep  occupants positioned properly. • properly secure child restraint  system as far away from the door as  possible. • do not place any objects over the  airbag. also, do not attach any objects  around the area the airbag inflates  such as the door, side door glass, front  and rear pillar, roof side rail. • do not hang other objects except  clothes, especially hard or breakable  objects. in an accident, it may cause vehicle  damage or personal injury. • do not allow passengers to lean their  heads or bodies onto doors, put their  arms on the doors, stretch their arms  out of the window, or place objects  between the doors and seats. • do not open or repair the side curtain  airbags.obn7i033040 obn7i033040

during a moderate to severe frontal  collision, sensors will detect the  vehicle’s rapid deceleration. if the rate of  deceleration is high enough, the control  unit will inflate the front airbags, at the  time and with the force needed. the front airbags help protect the driver  and front passenger by responding to  frontal impacts in which seat belts alone  cannot provide adequate restraint. when  needed, the side airbags help provide  protection in the event of a side impact  by supporting the side upper body area. • airbags are activated (able to inflate if  necessary) when the ignition switch is  in the on position or about with in 3  minutes after ignition off. • airbags inflate in the event of certain  frontal or side collisions to help  protect the occupants from serious  physical injury. • there is no single speed at which the  airbags will inflate. generally, airbags  are designed to inflate based upon the  severity of a collision and its direction.  these two factors determine whether  the sensors produce an electronic  deployment/inflation signal. • airbag deployment depends on a  number of factors including vehicle  speed, angles of impact and the  density and stiffness of the vehicles  or objects which your vehicle impacts  during a collision. the determining  factors are not limited to those  mentioned above. • the front airbags will completely  inflate and deflate in an instant. it is  virtually impossible for you to see the  airbags inflate during an accident. it is  much more likely that you will simply  see the deflated airbags hanging out  of their storage compartments after  the collision.• to help provide protection, the  airbags must inflate rapidly. the speed  of airbag inflation is a consequence  of extremely short time in which  to inflate the airbag between the  occupant and the vehicle structures  before the occupant impacts those  structures. this speed of inflation  reduces the risk of serious or  lifethreatening injuries and is thus a  necessary part of airbag design. however, the rapid airbag inflation  can also cause injuries which can  include facial abrasions, bruises and  broken bones because the inflation  speed also causes the airbags to  expand with a great deal of force. • there are even circumstances under  which contact with the airbag can  cause fatal injuries, especially if the  occupant is positioned excessively  close to the airbag. you can take steps to reduce the risk of  being injured by an inflating airbag. the  greatest risk is sitting too close to the  airbag. an airbag needs space to inflate.  it is recommended that the driver leave  as much space as possible between  their chest and the center of the steering  wheel, while still being able to maintain  control of the vehicle.

what to expect after an airbag  inflates after a frontal or side airbag inflates, it  will deflate very quickly. airbag inflation  will not prevent the driver from seeing  out of the windshield or being able  to steer. curtain airbags may remain  partially inflated for some time after they  deploy.  warning after an airbag inflates, take the  following precautions: • open your windows and doors as  soon as possible after impact to  reduce prolonged exposure to the  smoke and powder released by the  inflating airbag. • do not touch the airbag storage area’s  internal components immediately  after an airbag has inflated. the  parts that come into contact with an  inflating airbag may be very hot. • always wash exposed skin areas  thoroughly with cold water and mild  soap. • we recommend that an authorized  hyundai dealer replace the airbag  immediately after deployment.  airbags are designed to be used only  once.noise and smoke from inflating  airbag when the airbags inflate, they make a  loud noise and may produce smoke and  powder in the air inside of the vehicle.  this is normal and is a result of the  ignition of the airbag inflator. after the  airbag inflates, you may feel substantial  discomfort in breathing because of the  contact of your chest with both the  seat belt and the airbag, as well as from  breathing the smoke and powder. the  powder may aggravate asthma for some  people. if you experience breathing  problems after an airbag deployment,  seek medical attention immediately. though the smoke and powder are  nontoxic, they may cause irritation to  the skin, eyes, nose, throat, etc. if this is  the case, wash and rinse with cold water  immediately and seek medical attention  if the symptoms persist.

airbag non-inflation conditions obn7i033046 obn7i033046 in certain low-speed collisions the  airbags may not deploy. the airbags are  designed not to deploy in such cases  because they may not provide benefits  beyond the protection of the seat belts. obn7i033047 obn7i033047 front airbags are not designed to inflate  in rear collisions, because occupants  are moved backward by the force of the  impact. in this case, inflated airbags  would not provide any additional benefit.obn7i033044 obn7i033044 front airbags may not inflate in side  impact collisions, because occupants  move in the direction of the collision,  and thus in side impacts, front airbag  deployment would not provide additional  occupant protection. however, side and curtain airbags may  inflate depending on the severity of  impact. obn7i033049 obn7i033049 in an angled collision, the force of impact  may direct the occupants in a direction  where the airbags would not be able to  provide any additional benefit, and thus  the sensors may not deploy any airbags.

tire pressure monitoring system  warning over-inflation or under-inflation can  reduce tire life, adversely affect vehicle  handling, and lead to sudden tire failure  that may cause loss of vehicle control  resulting in an accident. each tire, including the spare (if  provided), should be inspected monthly  when cold and inflated to the inflation  pressure recommended by the vehicle  manufacturer on the vehicle placard  or tire inflation pressure label. (if your  vehicle has tires of a different size than  the size indicated on the vehicle placard  or tire inflation pressure label, you should  determine the proper tire inflation  pressure for those tires.) as an added safety feature, your  vehicle has been equipped with a tire  pressure monitoring system (tpms)  that illuminates a low tire pressure  telltale when one or more of your tires is  significantly under-inflated. accordingly,  when the low tire pressure telltale  illuminates, you should stop and check  your tires as soon as possible, and inflate  them to the proper pressure. driving on  a significantly under-inflated tire causes  the tire to overheat and can lead to tire  failure. under-inflation also reduces fuel  efficiency and tire tread life, and may  affect the vehicle’s handling and  stopping ability. please note that the tpms is not a  substitute for proper tire maintenance,  and it is the driver’s responsibility to  maintain correct tire pressure, even if  under-inflation has not reached the level  to trigger illumination of the tpms low  tire pressure telltale.your vehicle has also been equipped with  a tpms malfunction indicator to indicate  when the system is not operating  properly. the tpms malfunction  indicator is combined with the low  tire pressure telltale. when the system  detects a malfunction, the telltale will  flash for about one minute and then  remain continuously illuminated. this  sequence will continue upon subsequent  vehicle start-ups as long as the  malfunction exists. when the malfunction indicator is  illuminated, the system may not be able  to detect or signal low tire pressure as  intended. tpms malfunctions may occur  for a variety of reasons, including the  installation of replacement or alternate  tires or wheels on the vehicle that  prevent the tpms from functioning  properly. always check the tpms malfunction  telltale after replacing one or more tires  or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that  the replacement or alternate tires and  wheels allow the tpms to continue to  function properly. notice if any of the below happens, we  recommend that you have the system  inspected by an authorized hyundai  dealer. 1. the low tire pressure telltale/  tpms malfunction indicator does  not illuminate for 3 seconds when  the ignition switch is moved to the  on position or when the engine is  running. 2. the tpms malfunction indicator  remains illuminated after blinking for  about 1 minute. 3. the low tire pressure position telltale  remains illuminated.

corrosion protection protecting your vehicle from corrosion by using the most advanced design  and construction practices to combat  corrosion, hyundai produces vehicles  of the highest quality. however, this is  only part of the job. to achieve the long- term corrosion resistance your vehicle  can deliver, the owner’s cooperation and  assistance is also required. common causes of corrosion the most common causes of corrosion  on your vehicle are: • road salt, dirt and moisture that is  allowed to accumulate underneath  the vehicle. • removal of paint or protective  coatings by stones, gravel, abrasion  or minor scrapes and dents which  leave unprotected metal exposed to  corrosion.high-corrosion areas if you live in an area where your vehicle is  regularly exposed to corrosive materials,  corrosion protection is particularly  important. some of the common causes  of accelerated corrosion are road salts,  dust control chemicals, ocean air and  industrial pollution. moisture breeds corrosion moisture creates the conditions in  which corrosion is most likely to occur.  for example, corrosion is accelerated  by high humidity, particularly when  temperatures are just above freezing. in  such conditions, the corrosive material is  kept in contact with the vehicle surfaces  by moisture that is slow to evaporate. mud is particularly corrosive because  it is slow to dry and holds moisture in  contact with the vehicle. although the  mud appears to be dry, it can still retain  moisture and promote corrosion. high temperatures can also accelerate  corrosion of parts that are not properly  ventilated so the moisture can be  dispersed. for all these reasons, it is  particularly important to keep your  vehicle clean and free of mud or  accumulations of other materials. this  applies not only to the visible surfaces  but particularly to the underside of the  vehicle.

emission control systemthe emission control system of your  vehicle is covered by a written limited  warranty. please see the warranty  information contained in the service  passport in your vehicle. your vehicle is equipped with an  emission control system to meet all  applicable emission regulations. there  are three emission control systems, as  follows. (1) crankcase emission control system (2) evaporative emission control system (3) exhaust emission control system in order to ensure the proper function  of the emission control systems, it  is recommended that you have your  vehicle inspected and maintained  by an authorized hyundai dealer in  accordance with the maintenance  schedule in this manual. notice for the inspection and maintenance test  (with electronic stability control (esc)  system) • to prevent the vehicle from misfiring  during dynamometer testing, turn  the electronic stability control (esc)  system off by pressing the esc switch  (esc off light illuminated). • after dynamometer testing is  completed, turn the esc system back  on by pressing the esc switch again.1. crankcase emission control  system the positive crankcase ventilation system  is employed to prevent air pollution  caused by blow-by gases being emitted  from the crankcase. this system supplies  fresh filtered air to the crankcase through  the air intake hose. inside the crankcase,  the fresh air mixes with blow-by gases,  which then pass through the pcv valve  into the induction system.2. evaporative emission control  system the evaporative emission control system  is designed to prevent fuel vapors from  escaping into the atmosphere. canister fuel vapors generated inside the fuel  tank are absorbed and stored in the  onboard canister. when the engine is  running, the fuel vapors absorbed in the  canister are drawn into the surge tank  through the purge control solenoid valve. purge control solenoid valve (pcsv) the purge control solenoid valve  is controlled by the engine control  module (ecm); when the engine coolant  temperature is low during idling, the  pcsv closes so that evaporated fuel  is not taken into the engine. after the  engine warms-up during ordinary  driving, the pcsv opens to introduce  evaporated fuel to the engine.

• do not operate the engine at high  idle speed for extended periods (5  minutes or more). • do not modify or tamper with any  part of the engine or emission control  system. we recommend that all  inspections and adjustments are  made by an authorized hyundai  dealer. • avoid driving with an extremely low  fuel level. running out of fuel could cause the  engine to misfire, damaging the  catalytic converter. gasoline particulate filter (gpf)   (if equipped) gasoline particulate filter (gpf) system  removes the soot in the exhaust gas. the gpf system automatically burns  (or oxidizes) the accumulated soot in  accordance with driving situations,  unlike a disposable air filter. in other words, the accumulated soot is  automatically purged out by the engine  control system and by the high exhaust- gas temperature at normal/ high driving  speeds. however, when the vehicle is continually  driven at repeated short distances or  driven at low speed for a long time,  the accumulated soot may not be  automatically removed because of low  exhaust gas temperature. in this case,  the accumulated soot may reach a  certain amount regardless of the soot  oxidization process, then the gpf lamp   ( ) will illuminate.the gasoline particulate filter (gpf)  lamp stops illuminating, when the driving  speed exceeds 80 km/h (50 mph) with  engine rpm 1,500 ~ 4,000 and the gear  in the 3rd position or above for about 30  minutes. when the gpf lamp starts to blink or  the warning message “check exhaust  system” pops up even though the  vehicle was driven as mentioned above,  we recommend that you have the  gpf system checked by an authorized  hyundai dealer. with gpf lamp blinking for an extended  period of time, it may damage the gpf  system and lower the fuel economy.  caution we recommend you to use only the  regulated gasoline fuels, when your  vehicle is equipped with the gpf system. when you use other gasoline fuels which  contain unspecified additives, they may  damage the gpf system and cause  exhaust emission problems.
