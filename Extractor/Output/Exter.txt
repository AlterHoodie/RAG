foreword thank you for choosing hyundai. we are pleased to welcome you to the growing  number of discriminating people who drive hyundai. the advanced engineering and  high-quality construction of each hyundai we build is something of which we’re very  proud. your owner’s manual will introduce you to the features and operation of your new  hyundai. it is suggested that you read it carefully because the information it contains  can contribute greatly to the satisfaction you receive from your new car. the manufacturer also recommends that service and maintenance on your vehicle be  performed by an authorized hyundai dealer. hyundai motor company note :   because future owners will also need the information included in this manual,  if you sell this hyundai, please leave the manual in the vehicle for their use.  thank you.  caution severe engine and transmission damage may result from the use of poor quality  fuels and lubricants that do not meet hyundai specifications. you must always use  high quality fuels and lubricants that meet the specifications listed on page 2-10 in  the vehicle specifications section of the owner’s manual. copyright 2023 hyundai motor company. all rights reserved. no part of this  publication may be reproduced, stored in any retrieval system or transmitted in  any form or by any means without the prior written permission of hyundai motor  company.

fuel requirements petrol engine unleaded your new vehicle is designed to perform optimally using unleaded fuel having an  octane rating of ron (research octane number) 91 / aki (anti-knock index) 87 or  higher. (do not use methanol blended fuels) your new vehicle is designed to obtain maximum performance with unleaded fuel,  as well as minimize exhaust emissions and spark plug fouling. notice never use leaded fuel. the use of leaded fuel is detrimental to the catalytic  converter and will damage the engine control system’s oxygen sensor and affect  emission control.  also, severe wear and crack of piston ring, valve, etc. may occur and knocking noise  may be heard from your engine. never add any fuel system cleaning agents to the fuel tank other than what has  been specified (we recommend that you consult an authorized hyundai dealers  for details.)  warning • do not “top off” after the nozzle automatically shuts off when refueling. • always check that the fuel cap is installed securely to prevent fuel spillage in the  event of an accident.

petrol containing alcohol and methanol gasohol, a mixture of petrol and ethanol (also known as grain alcohol), and petrol or  gasohol containing methanol (also known as wood alcohol) are being marketed along  with or instead of leaded or unleaded petrol. do not use gasohol containing more than 20% ethanol, and do not use petrol or  gasohol containing any methanol. either of these fuels may cause drivability problems  and damage to the fuel system, engine control system and emission control system. discontinue using gasohol of any kind if drivability problems occur. vehicle damage or driveability problems may not be covered by the manufacturer’s  warranty if they result from the use of: 1.   gasohol containing more than 20% ethanol. 2.   petrol or gasohol containing methanol. 3.   leaded fuel or leaded gasohol.  caution never use gasohol which contains methanol. discontinue use of any gasohol  product which impairs drivability.   using fuel additives using fuel additives such as: - silicone fuel additive - mmt (manganese, mn) fuel additive - ferrocene (iron-based) fuel additive - other metallic-based fuel additives may result in cylinder misfire, poor acceleration, engine stalling, engine plugging,  heavy knocking noise, damage to the catalyst, or abnormal corrosion, and may cause  damage to the engine resulting in a reduction in the overall life of the powertrain. the  malfunction indicator lamp (mil) may illuminate. notice damage to the fuel system or performance problem caused by the use of these  fuels may not be covered by your new vehicle limited warranty.

use of mtbe hyundai recommends avoiding fuels containing mtbe (methyl tertiary butyl ether)  over 15.0% vol. (oxygen content 2.7% weight) in your vehicle. fuel containing mtbe over 15.0% vol. (oxygen content 2.7% weight) may reduce  vehicle performance and produce vapor lock or hard starting.   caution your new vehicle limited warranty may not cover damage to the fuel system and  any performance problems that are caused by the use of fuels containing methanol  or fuels containing mtbe (methyl tertiary butyl ether) over 15.0% vol. (oxygen  content 2.7% weight.) do not use methanol fuels containing methanol (wood alcohol) should not be used in your vehicle. this  type of fuel can reduce vehicle performance and damage components of the fuel  system, engine control system and emission control system. fuel additives hyundai recommends that you use unleaded petrol which has an  octane rating of  ron (research octane number) 91 / aki (anti-knock index) 87 or higher.  for customers who do not use good quality petrols including fuel additives regularly,  and have problems starting or the engine does not run smoothly, one bottle of  additives added to the fuel tank at every 10,000 km.  additives are available from your authorized hyundai dealer along with information  on how to use them. do not mix other additives. operation in foreign countries if you are going to drive your vehicle in another country, be sure to: • observe all regulations regarding registration and insurance. • determine that acceptable fuel is available.

vehicle modifications this vehicle should not be modified. modification of your vehicle could affect its per- formance, safety or durability and may even violate governmental safety and emis- sions regulations. • in addition, damage or performance problems resulting from any modification may  not be covered under warranty. • if you use unauthorized electronic devices, it may cause the vehicle to operate  abnormally, wire damage, battery discharge and fire. for your safety, do not use  unauthorized electronic devices.

9(+,&/(%5($.ǘ,1352&(66 no special break-in period is needed. by following a few simple precautions for the  first 1,000 km (600 miles), you may add to the performance, economy and life of your  vehicle: • do not race the engine. • while driving, avoid sudden acceleration. • do not maintain a single speed for long periods of time, either fast or slow.   varying the engine speed is needed to properly break-in the engine. • avoid hard stops, except in emergencies, to allow the brakes to seat properly. • fuel economy and engine performance may vary depending on vehicle break-in  process and be stabilized after 6,000 km (4,000 miles). new engines may consume  more oil during the vehicle break-in period.

isofix anchorage and top-tether  anchorage (isofix system) for  children (if equipped) the isofix system holds a child  restraint system during driving and in  an accident. this system is designed  to make installation of the child  restraint system easier and reduce  the possibility of improperly installing  your child restraint system. the isofix  system uses anchors in the vehicle and  attachments on the child restraint  system. the isofix system eliminates  the need to use seat belts to secure the  child restraint system to the rear seats. isofix anchors are metal bars built into  the vehicle. there are two lower anchors  for each isofix seating position that will  accommodate a child restraint system  with lower attachments. to use the isofix system in your  vehicle, you must have a child restraint  system with isofix attachments. (an  isofix-child restraint system may only  be installed if it has vehicle-specific or  universal approval in accordance with  the requirements of ece-r 44 or ece-r  129.) the child restraint system manufacturer  will provide you with instructions on how  to use the child restraint system with its  attachments for the lower anchorages.isofix anchorages have been provided  in the left and right outboard rear  seating positions. their locations are  shown in the illustration. there are no  isofix anchorages provided for the  center rear seating position.  warning do not attempt to install a child  restraint system using isofix  anchorages in the rear center  seating position. there are no isofix  anchorages provided for this seat.  using the outboard seat anchorages,  for the crs installation on the rear  center seating position, can damage  the anchorages which may break or fail  in a collision resulting in serious injury  or death.

warning • even in vehicles with airbags, you  and your passengers must always  wear the safety belts provided  in order to minimize the risk and  severity of injury in the event of a  collision or rollover. • srs and pretensioners contain  explosive chemicals.   if scraping a vehicle without  removing srs and pretensioners  from a vehicle, it may cause fire.  before scraping a vehicle, we  recommend that you contact an  authorized hyundai dealer. • keep the srs parts and wirings away  from water or any liquid. if the srs  components are inoperative due to  exposure to water or liquids, it may  cause fire or severe injury.how does the airbag system  operate  • airbags are activated (able to inflate  if necessary) only when the ignition  switch is placed to the on or start  position. • airbags inflate instantly in the event of  serious frontal or side collision in order  to help protect the occupants from  serious physical injury.  • there is no single speed at which the  airbags will inflate.   generally, airbags are designed to  inflate based upon the severity of a  collision and its direction. these two  factors determine whether the sensors  produce an electronic deployment/  inflation signal. • airbag  deployment depends on a  number of factors including vehicle  speed, angles of impact and the  density and stiffness of the vehicles or  objects which your vehicle hits in the  collision. the determining, factors are  not limited to those mentioned above. • the front airbags will completely  inflate and deflate in an instant.   it is virtually impossible for you to see  the airbags inflate during an accident.   it is much more likely that you will  simply see the deflated airbags  hanging out of their storage  compartments after the collision.

noise and smoke when the airbags inflate, they make a  loud noise and they leave smoke and  powder in the air inside of the vehicle.  this is normal and is a result of the  ignition of the airbag inflator. after the  airbag inflates, you may feel substantial  discomfort in breathing due to the  contact of your chest with both the  seat belt and the airbag, as well as from  breathing the smoke and powder. open  your doors and/or windows as soon as  possible after impact in order to reduce  discomfort and prevent prolonged  exposure to the smoke and powder.  though smoke and powder are non- toxic, it may cause irritation to the skin  (eyes, nose and throat, etc.). if this is  the case, wash and rinse with cold water  immediately and consult with the doctor  if the symptom persists.   warning when the airbags deploy, the airbag  related parts in the steering wheel  are very hot. to prevent injury, do not  touch the airbag storage area’s internal  components immediately after an  airbag has inflated.do not install a child restraint on  the front passenger’s seat   (if equipped)never place a rear-facing child restraint  in the front passenger’s seat. if the  airbag deploys, it would impact the rear- facing child restraint, causing serious or  fatal injury. in addition, do not place front-facing  child restraints in the front passenger’s  seat either. if the front passenger airbag  inflates, it would cause serious or fatal  injuries to the child.oydesa2042 oydesa2042

side airbags (if equipped) side airbags (side impact and/or curtain  airbags) are designed to inflate when  an impact is detected by side collision  sensors depending on the crash severity,  speed or angles of impact resulting from  a side impact collision. although the front airbags (driver’s and  front passenger’s airbags) are designed  to inflate only in frontal collisions,  they also may inflate in other types of  collisions if the front impact sensor  detects a sufficient impact. side airbags  (side  impact and/or curtain airbags) are  designed to inflate only in side impact  collisions, but they may inflate in other  collisions if the side impact sensors  detect a sufficient impact. if the vehicle chassis is impacted by  bumps or objects on unimproved roads  or sidewalks, airbags may deploy.  drive carefully on unimproved roads  or on surfaces not designed for vehicle  traffic to prevent unintended airbag  deployment.airbag non-inflation conditions oai3v033026 oai3v033026 • in certain low-speed collisions, the  airbags may not deploy. the airbags  are designed not to deploy in such  cases because they may not provide  benefits beyond the protection of the  seat belts in such collisions. oai3v033027 oai3v033027 • front airbags are not designed to  inflate in rear collisions, because  occupants are moved backward by  the force of the impact. in this case,  inflated airbags would not be able to  provide any additional benefit.oai3v033047 oai3v033047



col0,03

• airbags may not inflate if the vehicle  collides with objects such as utility  poles or trees, where the point of  impact is concentrated and the  collision energy is absorbed by the  vehicle structure.srs care the srs is virtually maintenance free  and so there are no parts you can  safely service by yourself. if the srs  airbag warning light does not illuminate  approximately 6sec after ignition switch  turned on, or continuously remains  on, we recommend that the system be  inspected by an authorized hyundai  dealer. we recommend that the any work on the  srs system, such as removing, installing  or repairing, or any work on the steering  wheel, the front passenger’s panel, front  seats or roof rails be performed by an  authorized hyundai dealer. improper  handling of the srs system may result in  serious personal injury.  warning • modification to srs components  or wiring, including the addition  of any kind of badges to the pad  covers or modifications to the body  structure, can adversely affect srs  performance and lead to possible  injury. • for cleaning the airbag pad covers,  use only a soft, dry cloth or one which  has been moistened with plain water.  solvents or cleaners could adversely  affect the airbag covers and proper  deployment of the system.

fm reception fm receptionam broadcasts can be received at  greater distances than fm broadcasts.  this is because am radio waves are  transmitted at low frequencies. these  long distance, low frequency radio  waves can follow the curvature of the  earth rather than travelling straight. in  addition, they curve around obstructions  resulting in better signal coverage.fm reception fm receptionfm broadcasts are transmitted at high  frequencies and do not bend to follow  the earth’s surface. because of this,  fm broadcasts generally begin to fade  within short distances from the station.  also, fm signals are easily affected by  buildings, mountains, and obstructions.  this can lead to undesirable or  unpleasant listening conditions which  might lead you to believe a problem  exists with your radio.the following conditions are normal and  do not indicate radio trouble:fm reception fm receptionjbm002 jbm002• fading - as your vehicle moves away  from the radio station, the signal will  weaken and sound will begin to fade.  when this occurs, we suggest that you  select another stronger station. • flutter/static - weak fm signals  or large obstructions between the  transmitter and your radio can disturb  the signal causing static or fluttering  noises to occur. reducing the treble  level may lessen this effect until the  disturbance clears.jbm003 jbm003jbm004 jbm004

tire pressure monitoring system  warning over-inflation or under-inflation can  reduce tire life, adversely affect vehicle  handling, and lead to sudden tire  failure that may cause loss of vehicle  control resulting in an accident. each tire, including the spare (if  provided), should be checked monthly  when cold and inflated to the inflation  pressure recommended by the vehicle  manufacturer on the vehicle placard  or tire inflation pressure label. (if your  vehicle has tires of a different size  than the size indicated on the vehicle  placard or tire inflation pressure label,  you should determine the proper tire  inflation pressure for those tires.) as an added safety feature, your  vehicle has been equipped with a tire  pressure monitoring system (tpms)  that illuminates a low tire pressure  telltale when one or more of your tires is  significantly under-inflated.  accordingly, when the low tire pressure  telltale illuminates, you should stop and  check your tires as soon as possible,  and inflate them to the proper pressure.  driving on a significantly under-inflated  tire causes the tire to overheat and can  lead to tire failure.  under-inflation also  reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life,  and may affect the vehicle’s handling  and stopping ability. please note that the tpms is not a  substitute for proper tire maintenance,  and it is the driver’s responsibility to  maintain correct tire pressure, even if  under-inflation has not reached the level  to trigger illumination of the tpms low  tire pressure telltale.your vehicle has also been equipped  with a tpms malfunction indicator  to indicate when the system is  not operating properly. the tpms  malfunction indicator is combined with  the low tire pressure telltale. when  the system detects a malfunction, the  telltale will flash for approximately one  minute and then remain continuously  illuminated. this sequence will continue  upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as  long as the malfunction exists. when  the malfunction indicator is illuminated,  the system may not be able to detect  or signal low tire pressure as intended.  tpms malfunctions may occur for  a variety of reasons, including the  installation of replacement or alternate  tires or wheels on the vehicle that  prevent the tpms from functioning  properly.  always check the tpms  malfunction telltale after replacing  one or more tires or wheels on your  vehicle to ensure that the replacement  or alternate tires and wheels allow the  tpms to continue to function properly. notice if any of the below happens, we  recommend that you have the system  checked by an authorized hyundai  dealer. 1. the low tire pressure telltale/ tpms  malfunction indicator does not  illuminate for 3 seconds when the  engine start/stop button is pressed  to the on position or when the  engine is running. 2. the tpms malfunction indicator  remains illuminated after blinking for  approximately 1 minute. 3. the low tire pressure position  telltale remains illuminated.
